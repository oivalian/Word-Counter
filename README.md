# Word Counter
A simple counter for text files.

I am currently writing a science fiction novel and wanted to get a count overused words.
Why use the command line when you can make your own pointless counter just for fun.

> [!Note]
>  Create a folder in the root dir titled ```files```. Save your notepad files in here.
