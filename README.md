# Word-Counter
A simple counter for large text files.

I am currently writing a science fiction novel and wanted to get a count overused words. Why use inbuilt features of text editors when you can have some fun and make your own.

*** Note: Create a folder in main .py root dir and title it 'files'. Save your notepad files in here ***
